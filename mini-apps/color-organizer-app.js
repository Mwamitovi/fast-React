/**
 * Representational state of our app * 
 * The entire state of the color organizer can be represented with a single array.
 * This array describes three colors: ocean at dusk, lawn, and bright red. 
 * It gives us the colorsâ€™ hex values and the current rating for each color. 
 * It also provides a way to uniquely identify each color.
 * 
 * This state data will drive our application. It's our "single source of truth".
 * It will be used to construct the UI every time this object changes. 
 * When users add or remove colors, they will be added to or removed from this array.
 * When users rate colors, their ratings will change in the array.
