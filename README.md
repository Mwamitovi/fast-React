Fast React
==========

## SYNOPSIS

The world is reacting, and this is a series of "mini" React projects.
We look at the concepts of functional programming inorder to structure React Applications better.

What's happening behind the scenes? 
We look at Pure React. 
And quickly switch focus to a JavaScript extension (JSX), similar to HTML, for defining react elements.

But really, what is the React advantage? 
We dig into Data handling and Component lifecycle to answer this question.
Then we get on to use Redux (based on flux) to manage application state while building the UI.

We also Unit test using tools like ESLint, Jest and Enzyme to verify our "app" functions.
Plus how do we manage browser history in Single-Pages-Apps with React Router?
And finally, we get into React and the server (isomorphic concept, node-express and more).
