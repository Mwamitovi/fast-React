Fast React
==========

## SYNOPSIS

The world is reacting, and this is a series of "mini" React projects.
We look at the concepts of functional programming inorder to structure React Applications better. 
And then dive into Pure React (What's heppening behind the scenes), 
JSX (A JavaScript extension, similar to HTML, for defining react elements),
Data handling and Component lifecycle (the react advantage),
Redux (based on flux, to manage application state, while building UI),
Unit testing (using ESLint, Jest and Enzyme to verify our "app" functions),
React router (managing browser history in Single-Pages-Apps),
React and the server (isomorphic concept, node-express and more).


## IMPORTANT

** You need, but are not limited to,
   - yarn (package manager created at Facebook)(npm can also work)*
   - ES6(es2105)
